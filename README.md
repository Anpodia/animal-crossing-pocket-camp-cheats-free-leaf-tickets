Animal Crossing Pocket Camp Cheats free leaf tickets Hacks tricks - Remember that you can only get points for each item you visit and your friend to complete these tasks. After completing these animals' requests, you can still talk to them, but that's all - talking to them won't get any other rewards in the game. So if you want to score all your items and friends in one day, it means you really need to get up all day or sleep no more than three hours. This is because you need to register every three hours and complete all requests from the new fauna. Animals in your own camp will not follow a similar rotation pattern and will leave only when you decide to drive them away; Again, no animal in your camp can make three requests at a time instead of insisting on a request / task or a conversation for an hour.
